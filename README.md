# HTML-basics-abbreviations
This basically just abbreviates what you set it to, use the keyword &lt;abbr> be careful when closing these &lt;> arrows, in this example you will see the arrows open, then the title is set and then the abbreviation of that title is set, then the abbr arrow closes (&lt;)
